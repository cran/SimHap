Description: SimHap is a package for genetic association testing. It
        can perform single SNP and multi-locus (haplotype) association
        analyses for continuous Normal, binary, longitudinal and
        right-censored outcomes measured in population-based samples.
        SimHap uses estimation maximisation techniques for inferring
        haplotypic phase in individuals, and incorporates a novel
        simulation-based approach to deal with the uncertainty of
        imputed haplotypes in association testing.
