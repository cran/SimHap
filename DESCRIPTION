Description: SimHap is a package for genetic association testing. It can perform single SNP and multi-locus (haplotype) association analyses for continuous Normal, binary, longitudinal and right-censored outcomes measured in population-based samples. SimHap uses estimation maximisation techniques for inferring haplotypic phase in individuals, and incorporates a multiple-imputation approach to deal with the uncertainty of imputed haplotypes in association testing.
